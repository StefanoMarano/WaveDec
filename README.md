## WaveDec: a tool for wavefield decomposition

WaveDec is a software for the analysis of seismic surface waves. It provides maximum likelihood estimates of wave parameters for Love and Rayleigh waves. All the sensor components are analysed jointly. The simultaneous presence of multiple modes of propagation and multiple wave types (i.e., Love and Rayleigh) is accounted for. Estimated wave parameters include: Love and Rayleigh wave wavenumber, Rayleigh wave ellipticity angle, wave amplitude, and direction of arrival.
